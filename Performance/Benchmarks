BENCHMARK

Code performance are very important. Optimize code can lead to:
- faster execution
- energy saving

There are several modes to benchmark c++ code:
- Set Timer in the code (be careful to Debug - Release optimization)
- Use external tools
  - perf (performance events counter)
  - compiler Explorer (https://godbolt.org/)
- use external library
  - Google Benchmark


Measure first, tune what matters! You need all information to make the right decision.
Go deep in assembly code

Google Benchmark library:
- used for micro BM (really isolated part of the system)
- processes multile input using range_x data type
- need for isolating things to BM
